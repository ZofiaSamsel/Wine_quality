Dear Marc,

Thanks for your guidance during yesterday's office hour. 

Based on your suggestions, we've updated the outline of our project. If there is anything missing or we misunderstood, please let us know.


1. **Introduction to the Data Set**
   1.1. General Information
   1.2. Information about the Wine
   1.3. Information about the Datasets

2. **Research Questions and Motivations**
   2.1. Research Questions
   2.2. Motivations

3. **Data Analysis**
   3.1. Extract Data
   3.2. Transformation
       - Creation of QQ Plots
       - Analysis of Skewness Coefficients
       - Log Transformation for Skewed Features
   3.3. Cleaning Data
       3.3.1. Checking for Missing Values
       3.3.2. Outlier Analysis
           - Box Plots for Outlier Detection
           - Further Analysis Based on Wine Quality Categories (Four Groups: Low/High Quality in Red Wine and White Wine)
           - Z-score Analysis for Extreme Outliers & Delete Extreme Outliers
   3.4. Feature Selection and Correlation Analysis
       - Clustermaps to Understand Feature Relationships
       - Output: Various Combinations of Eight Features
       - Optinal: Bioinformatics Heatmap

4. **Model Building**
   - Piecewise Linear Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning
   - Performance Metrics: R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE),  Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficients, p-value, t-value.

5. **Visualize Data**
   - Visualization of Low/High Quality for Red and White Wine: Including p-value, Error Bar, and Number of Data Points
   - Comparison of Data Before and After Log Transformation / Outlier Removal: Illustrating the Impact on Data, e.g., Data Loss

6. **Conclusion & Discussions**
   - Summarizing Key Findings and Their Implications for Wine Production


Thanks for your help in advance.
