# üçá Unveiling the Secrets of Wine Quality üç∑

> Bypassing traditional tasting methods, this project employs data analysis to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical features.

In our project, our primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of wine quality, focusing on its physicochemical properties.

Since the taste and overall quality of wine are influenced by a complex interplay of various characteristics, we aim to delve into the intricate relationships among these chemical properties. Our aspiration is to enhance the production of high-quality wine and provide valuable insights to winemakers.

Using data-driven methods, our goal is to develop a predictive model for wine quality, uncovering the most significant factors influencing quality. Additionally, we seek to discern the distinctions between white and red wines, unraveling unique physicochemical profiles for each type.

This project was completed as part of the LPI Data Science Course, under the guidance of Marc and Liubov.

## üç∑ 1. Introduction

   - *Impact on Taste and Quality*: Adds a citrusy character and contributes to acidity.
4. **Residual Sugar (g/dm¬≥)**: 
   - *Role in Production*: Determines sweetness level after fermentation.
   - *Impact on Taste and Quality*: Influences perceived sweetness; higher levels result in a sweeter wine.
5. **Chlorides (g/dm¬≥)**: 
   - *Role in Production*: Salts influencing flavor and microbial stability.
   - *Impact on Taste and Quality*: Moderate levels contribute to structure; high levels may lead to a salty taste.
6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide (mg/dm¬≥)**: 
   - *Role in Production*: Exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 and bisulfite ion; prevents microbial growth and wine oxidation.
   - *Impact on Taste and Quality*: Maintains freshness, but excessive levels can result in a sulfurous aroma.
7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide (mg/dm¬≥)**: 
   - *Role in Production*: Includes both free and bound forms; measures overall sulfite content.
   - *Impact on Taste and Quality*: Crucial for preservation; excessive levels can affect the wine's quality.
8. **Density (g/cm¬≥)**: 
   - *Role in Production*: Indicates mass per unit volume; related to sugar and alcohol concentration.
   - *Impact on Taste and Quality*: Influences body and mouthfeel; higher density contributes to a fuller-bodied wine.
9. **pH**: 
   - *Role in Production*: Measures acidity or alkalinity; influences stability and chemical reactions.
   - *Impact on Taste and Quality*: Affects color, flavor, and microbial stability; balanced pH is essential.
10. **Sulphates (g/dm¬≥)**: 
    - *Role in Production*: Added as sulfur dioxide; acts as an antioxidant and antimicrobial agent.
    - *Impact on Taste and Quality*: Proper use preserves freshness; too high level can lead to undesirable flavors.
11. **Alcohol (% by Volume)**: 
    - *Role in Production*: Byproduct of fermentation; contributes to body, mouthfeel, and structure.
    - *Impact on Taste and Quality*: Influences warmth, body, and balance; well-integrated alcohol is crucial for a harmonious taste.

#### 1.3.2 Potential Connections and Relationships:

- **Acidity and pH:**
  - *Connection:* The relationship between fixed acidity and pH is critical. Higher fixed acidity tends to lower the pH, influencing the wine's color, stability, and microbial environment.

- **Sugar and Alcohol:**
  - *Connection:* The level of residual sugar at the end of fermentation affects the final alcohol content. Balancing these elements is crucial for achieving the desired sweetness and alcohol levels.

- **Sulfur Dioxide and Volatile Acidity:**
  - *Connection:* Proper use of sulfur dioxide can help control volatile acidity, preventing the development of unwanted vinegar-like flavors.

- **Chlorides and Total Sulfur Dioxide:**
  - *Connection:* The balance between chlorides and total sulfur dioxide contributes to the wine's structure and preservation. Monitoring both helps avoid undesirable tastes.


## 2. Research Questions and Motivations

### 2.1 Research Questions
Our reserach questions enhances and expands upon prior studies by:

- üçá Which features contribute the most to predict good and poor quality of wine?
- üçá What is the recipe for a good and poor wine? 

### 2.2 Motivations:

- üá´üá∑ **Cultural Significance**: Studying in France, a nation celebrated for its wine tradition, we seek to deepen our understanding of wine. This analysisfosters a greater appreciation of this heritage.
- üçæ **Enhancing Wine Production:** Providing actionable insights for quality improvement through advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.
- üìä **Analytical Depth:** Leveraging data-driven methods to explore wine quality nuances. This exploration will enhance our analytical skills while shedding light on hidden characteristics within wines.

## 3. Data Analysis

### 3.1 üìä Statistical Analysis

- **Skewness Detection**: Utilizing Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plots, we analyze the distribution of wine qualities. Where skewness is evident, we apply logarithmic transformations to normalize the data. After the first log transformation, we found that not all transformations decrease skewness, so we chose two features from each dataset for a second log transformation.
- **Outlier Detection**: We employ boxplots and Z-score calculations (with a threshold of 6) to pinpoint outliers. The reason why we chose a threshold of 6 is that these chemical features do not significantly deviate from the norm (for example, compared to sales data). This approach helps in understanding and addressing anomalies in the dataset. We only deleted 18 outliers from these two datasets.

### 3.2 üõ†Ô∏è Model Building
- **Feature Selection**: Through cluster maps and correlation matrices, we explore the relationships between various features and wine quality. To avoid multicollinearity, we carefully select only one feature from groups of highly correlated attributes.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Noticing a distinct trend in wine alcohol level (quality 3-5 and 6-9), we employ piecewise linear regression. This method categorizes wines into quality tiers while assessing the impact of different factors on wine quality.
