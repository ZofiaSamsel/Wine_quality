## Background Info Intro: 

Discuss the background of the dataset.

## Research Questions
### Statistics Outliers Detection:
1. Assess the homogeneity of wine qualities from different vineyards to determine if they follow a Gaussian distribution. Utilize QQ plots alongside other statistical tests for illustration.
2. Explore potential causes of outliers or variations, such as temperature and precipitation variations during the growing season.

### Predicting Performance:
1. Categorize wines into different quality tiers (e.g., low, medium, high) based on scores from wine experts. Utilize logistic regression and grid search, while also considering other machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machines for this analysis. 
2. Evaluate the model's ability to predict the quality of the wine accurately. Identify the main contributing factors to wine quality, and assess the significance and interaction of these factors. 
3. Offer insights on measures to avoid the production of poor-quality wine based on the identified factors from the predictive analysis. 
4. Determine the factors that most significantly distinguish the best wines from others. Discuss the application of the t-test in examining the statistical significance of these distinguishing factors.


### Clustering:
1. Explore different compositions and characteristics of high-rated white/red wines to determine if variations such as sweet and dry wines exist, and whether their composition differs significantly.
2. Apply K-means clustering and consider comparing with other clustering algorithms. Utilize heat maps alongside other visualization techniques like dendrograms for a comprehensive visual representation.
