Bypassing traditional tasting methods, this project employs data analysis to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical features.

## Intro: 

## üç∑ 1. Introduction about the Data Set

### üìñ 1.1 General Information:
- **Provided by**: [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine).
- **Donated by**: Paulo Cortez, Antonio Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos, and Jose Reis.
   - üìú **Their paper**: [Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties](https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/10029/1/wine5.pdf).
   - üßê **Main idea**: Using data mining to understand how various factors influence wine quality, offering insights into wine production and certification. 
   - ‚öíÔ∏è **Approach**: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), and Multiple Regression (MR) techniques.
   - üß∞ **Conclusion**: 
     - For assessing wine quality, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method outperforms other techniques in accuracy, especially for white wines.
     - Alcohol level is a key factor in determining wine quality. Citric acid and residual sugar are more significant in white wines, whereas sulphates are highly important in both types.

### üçá 1.2 Info about the Wine:
- **Types**: Both white and red wines from the Vinho Verde region in northwestern Portugal üáµüáπ.
- **Production**: Represents 15% of Portuguese production.

### üìä 1.3 Info about the Datasets:
- **Wines**: 1599 red and 4898 white samples.
- **Collection**:
   - ‚è≥ Timeframe: May 2004 to February 2007.
   - üè∑Ô∏è Type: Only protected designation of origin samples by CVRVV (Comiss√£o de Viticultura da Regi√£o dos Vinhos Verdes), focused on enhancing the quality and marketing of vinho verde.
- **Quality Assessment**:
   - Rated by at least three sensory assessors (blind tastes), on a 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent) scale. The final score is the median of these ratings.
- **Chemical Features Tested**:
   - üß™ Data recorded by iLab, a computerized system managing wine sample testing.
   - Tests include density, alcohol, pH values, etc.
- **Limitation**:
  - Lack of Temporal Information:
    - We are unable to analyze variations in wine quality across different years, also making it impossible for us to identify the relationship between weather conditions and wine quality.
  - Lack of Brand and Public Preference Data: 
    - We are unable to establish a direct link between wine quality attributes and consumer preferences or sales performance. 

In our project, our primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of wine quality, focusing on its psychochemical properties. Since the taste and overall quality of wine are influenced by a complex interplay of various characteristics, we aim to delve into the intricate relationships among these chemical properties. By doing so, we aspire to enhance the production of high-quality wine and offer valuable insights to winemakers. Using data-driven methods, our goal is to design a predictive model for wine quality and uncovering the most important factor influencing the quality. Additionally, we seek to discern the distinctions between white and red wine, unraveling unique psychochemical profiles for each type.

The dataset was firstly introduced in the *Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties* by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos, J. Reis. 2009.* The authors used novel method *the sensitivity analysis* NN and SVM metchods to analyze wine quaity.

**Datasets** The dataset describes Red Wine (1599 data points) and White Wine (4898 data points) of *vinho verde*, product from the Minho (northwest) region of Portugal. The data were collected from May 2004 to February 2007 *(Cortez et al.,2020)*.

**Dataset Features:**
1. **Fixed Acidity (g/dm¬≥):**
   - *Role in Production:* Represents the total concentration of acids.
   - *Impact on Taste and Quality:* Influences freshness, crispness, and aging potential.

2. **Volatile Acidity (g/dm¬≥):**
   - *Role in Production:* Includes vaporizing acids; can contribute to complexity in moderation.
   - *Impact on Taste and Quality:* High levels can result in a vinegar-like taste.

3. **Citric Acid (g/dm¬≥):**
