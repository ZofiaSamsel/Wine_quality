# Unveiling the Secrets of Wine Quality 

- **Objective**: Predicting wine quality using chemical features.

- **Sources:** UCIML Python Library and CSV files.
<br>

- **Data Sets:** Red Wine 🍷 (**1599** data points) and White Wine 🥂 datasets (**4898** data points) 
  - the Vinho Verde wine (from the Minho region of Portugal) taste preferences
  - Both datasets include physicochemical properties of wine and quality scores.
  - Example features: Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, etc.
  - Data spans various quality levels from 0 to 10.

# Research Questions and Motivation

### Key Research Areas 🔍
- **Statistics & Outliers:** Assessing wine quality homogeneity and exploring outliers.
- **Predictive Analysis:** Classifying wine quality tiers, evaluating models like logistic regression and Random Forest for accuracy, and identifying key quality factors. 
- **Preventive Insights:** Developing strategies to prevent poor-quality production and determining distinguishing factors of top-quality wines. - K-mean Classtering (how many clusters)
- **Clustering Techniques:** Examining variations in high-rated wines and applying PCA for in-depth analysis.

<br>

### Driving Motivation 🚀
- **Analytical Depth:** Leveraging data-driven methods to explore wine quality nuances.
- **Enhancing Wine Production:** Providing actionable insights for quality improvement through advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.

# Current Progress in Wine Quality Analysis 📝

### Achievements ✅
- **Data Extraction:** Extracted data from csv files.
- **Outlier Analysis:** Identified outliers using scatter plots, box plots, and Z-scores.
- **Distribution Analysis:** QQ plots and skewness coefficients for distribution insights.

<br>

### Questions and Issues 🚧
- **Outlier Handling:** To keep or delete for model accuracy?
- **Data Normalization:** Addressing skewness, possibly using transformations.
- **Model Selection:** Determining effective predictive models for wine quality.

<br>


### Next Steps 🛤️
- Explore data normalization techniques.
- Begin model development and testing (grid search for best model and hyperparameters).
