    "## 🍷 1. Introduction about the Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 1.1 General Information:\n",
    "- **Provided by**: [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine).\n",
    "- **Donated by**: Paulo Cortez, Antonio Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos, and Jose Reis.\n",
    "   - 📜 **Their paper**: [Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties](https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/10029/1/wine5.pdf).\n",
    "   - 🧐 **Main idea**: Using data mining to understand how various factors influence wine quality, offering insights into wine production and certification. \n",
    "   - ⚒️ **Approach**: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), and Multiple Regression (MR) techniques.\n",
    "   - 🧰 **Conclusion**: \n",
    "     - For assessing wine quality, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method outperforms other techniques in accuracy, especially for white wines.\n",
    "     - Alcohol level is a key factor in determining wine quality. Citric acid and residual sugar are more significant in white wines, whereas sulphates are highly important in both types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🍇 1.2 Info about the Wine:\n",
    "- **Types**: Both white and red wines from the Vinho Verde region in northwestern Portugal 🇵🇹.\n",
    "- **Production**: Represents 15% of Portuguese production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 1.3 Info about the Datasets:\n",
    "- **Wines**: 1599 red and 4898 white samples.\n",
    "- **Collection**:\n",
    "   - ⏳ Timeframe: May 2004 to February 2007.\n",
    "   - 🏷️ Type: Only protected designation of origin samples by CVRVV (Comissão de Viticultura da Região dos Vinhos Verdes), focused on enhancing the quality and marketing of vinho verde.\n",
    "- **Quality Assessment**:\n",
    "   - Rated by at least three sensory assessors (blind tastes), on a 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent) scale. The final score is the median of these ratings.\n",
    "- **Chemical Features Tested**:\n",
    "   - 🧪 Data recorded by iLab, a computerized system managing wine sample testing.\n",
    "   - Tests include density, alcohol, pH values, etc.\n",
    "- **Limitation**:\n",
    "  - Lack of Temporal Information:\n",
    "    - We are unable to analyze variations in wine quality across different years, also making it impossible for us to identify the relationship between weather conditions and wine quality.\n",
    "  - Lack of Brand and Public Preference Data: \n",
    "    - We are unable to establish a direct link between wine quality attributes and consumer preferences or sales performance. "
