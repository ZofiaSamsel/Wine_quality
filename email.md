**Email Title:** Update and Documentation of Suggestions for the Wine Quality Project

Dear Marc and Liubov,

We are writing to summarize the latest updates on our wine quality project and to document the valuable suggestions you provided during our presentation and office hours.

**Project Update:**

We have successfully completed the preliminary phase of our project. To document our progress, we have attached an HTML file from our Jupyter Book and the slides from our presentation.

**Documented Suggestions:**

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Clarify the specific timeframe or period during which the data was collected.

2. **Outlier Analysis**:
   - Consider adjusting the z-score threshold to 5, as using 3 might be too conservative for the chemical features in our dataset.

3. **High Correlation Between Predictors**:
   - For instances of high correlation between predictors, we plan to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for effective dimensionality reduction.

4. **Quality Analysis**:
   - Integrate a histogram to effectively visualize the distribution of wine quality scores.

5. **QQ Plot for Wine Quality**:
   - Develop separate QQ plots for wines classified into different quality categories: bad(3-4), middle(5-6-7), and good(8-9) to better understand our outliers.

6. **Heatmap Modifications**:
   - Modify existing heatmaps to exclude correlations below 0.1, and highlight areas depicting higher correlations for more clarity.

7. **Log Transformation**:
   - Include a boxplot to illustrate the effects of logarithmic transformation on the data, offering insights into its impact on the dataset's characteristics.

Please let us know if we have misunderstood any of your notes or questions.

We would also like to request a meeting with Marc from 5 to 6 on Thursday, if that time is still available. We will send the Jupyter Book before the office hour for your review.

Thank you for your continued support and guidance.

Best regards,
Zofia and Fengyu
